                    <h2>A Journey of Purpose: The Story Behind AMARA</h2>
                    <p class="author-byline">By Isha Qureshi, Founder, AMARA</p>
                    <p>As I sit down to reflect on the journey of building AMARA, I find myself deeply moved by the stories, strength, and resilience of countless women who have shaped not just this brand, but my very purpose behind creating it.</p>
                    <p>Growing up in India, I was no stranger to the silence and stigma that often surrounds menstruation. It was something we whispered about, something that came with shame, discomfort, and a sense of inconvenience. I saw how young girls were often unprepared, misinformed, or even excluded from daily life during their periods — not because they were unwell, but simply because society conditioned them to feel that way.</p>
                    <p>That reality never sat right with me. Over time, this discomfort evolved into a quiet but powerful determination to be part of the change. I knew that menstruation, a natural biological process, deserved to be treated with dignity, care, and above all — respect.</p>

            <section class="values-section">
                <h2>The Birth of AMARA</h2>
                <p>AMARA was born from that passion — a desire to empower women with period care that truly prioritizes their health, comfort, and confidence. But beyond just a product, AMARA represents a deeper commitment: to challenge the outdated narratives around menstruation and replace them with education, empathy, and empowerment.</p>
                <p>Our sanitary napkins are made with certified organic materials, free from harmful chemicals, and designed to be gentle on the skin while being kind to the environment. We have worked tirelessly to ensure that every product we create meets the highest standards of quality, hygiene, and sustainability — because we believe that what we use on our bodies matters.</p>

            <section class="values-section hidden-content" style="display: none;">
                <h2>More Than a Brand – A Movement</h2>
                <p>At its core, AMARA is not just a brand. It's a movement — one that aims to redefine how we think, talk, and feel about periods. Our mission goes beyond selling sanitary products; we are working to break down the taboos, open up conversations, and create a community where menstruation is acknowledged and accepted as a natural, powerful part of life.</p>
                <p>Through workshops, educational initiatives, and community outreach, we're striving to ensure that every girl and woman feels informed, empowered, and unashamed of her body. We want to build a future where no woman is held back — in school, at work, or in her personal life — just because she's menstruating.</p>

                <h2>Thank You for Walking With Us</h2>
                <p>To everyone who has supported us — whether by choosing AMARA, sharing our story, or simply starting a conversation — thank you. Your belief in our vision fuels our mission every single day.</p>
                <p>This is only the beginning. Together, let's continue to build a world where every woman can thrive, not in spite of her period, but alongside it — with pride, comfort, and strength.</p>
